Steps:

1. line 226 and 142 in your dbcontroller class was using student_name columns in this query :

OLD
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT student_name FROM students WHERE student_id = " + studentID);
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT student_name FROM students WHERE student_id = " + studentIDs.elementAt(i));

NEW
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE student_id = " + studentID);
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT first_name FROM students WHERE student_id = " + studentIDs.elementAt(i));


Your database has no such column, so, I have changed above lines to first_name.


2. line 246 , there was not course_title coulumn as well, I have changed it to title

OLD
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT course_title FROM courses WHERE course_id = \"" + courseID + "\"");

NEW
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT title FROM courses WHERE course_id = \"" + courseID + "\"");

3. 

line 268 , there was not instructor_name coulumn as well, I have changed it to first_name

OLD
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT instructor_name FROM instructors WHERE instructor_id = " + instructorID);

NEW
====
rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT first_name FROM instructors WHERE instructor_id = " + instructorID);


4. getCoursesByInstructor -method was using instructor_name, but db had instructor id. I have changed it as well (line 286-292)

OLD===
	public Vector<Course> getCoursesByInstructor(String instructorName) throws SQLException {
		Vector<Course> instructorSchedule = new Vector<Course>();
		
		try {
			con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, dbUser, dbPassword);
			statement = con.createStatement();
			rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM courses WHERE course_instructor = \"" + instructorName + "\"");
			
			
			
NEW===
public Vector<Course> getCoursesByInstructor(int instructorId) throws SQLException {
		Vector<Course> instructorSchedule = new Vector<Course>();
		
		try {
			con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, dbUser, dbPassword);
			statement = con.createStatement();
			rs = statement.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM courses WHERE instructor_id = \"" + instructorId + "\"");
